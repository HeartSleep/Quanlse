    "Generally, when modeling superconducting systems, we use the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{\\rm sys}$ to describe the total energy of the entire system: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H}_{\\rm sys} = \\hat{H}_{\\rm drift} + \\hat{H}_{\\rm coup} + \\hat{H}_{\\rm ctrl}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It typically contains three terms - the time-independent drift term describing the individual qubits in the system, the coupling term describing the qubits interaction, and the time-dependent control term describing the control fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Hamiltonian constructed, we can simulate the evolution of the quantum system using Schr√∂dinger equation in the Heisenberg picture and obtain the time-ordered evolution operator $U(t)$,\n",
