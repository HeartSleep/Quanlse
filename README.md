[Quanlse (量脉)](https://quanlse.baidu.com) is a cloud-based platform for quantum control developed by the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com). Quanlse aims to bridge the gap between quantum software and hardware. It provides efficient and professional quantum control solutions via an open-source SDK strengthened by the Quanlse Could Service.

Quanlse supports the pulse generation and scheduling of arbitrary single-qubit and two-qubit gates. With the help of toolkits in Quanlse, one can also use Quanlse for modeling physical devices, simulating dynamical evolution, and visualizing error analysis. More interestingly, users can achieve pulse-level control of quantum algorithms using the tools in Quanlse. Furthermore, Quanlse also supports advanced research and development (R&D) in the field of quantum control.

## Feedbacks
Users are encouraged to contact us through [Github Issues](https://github.com/baidu/Quanlse/issues) or quanlse@baidu.com with general questions, bugs, and potential improvements. We hope to make Quanlse better together with the community!
